Certainly! Hereâ€™s the revised README without the Dart installation process:

Hackathon Repo - Dart
Overview
This Dart project features three key functionalities:

Palindrome Checker: Determines if a given string or number is a palindrome.
Sorting Algorithms: Implements bubble sort and merge sort.
Basic Calculator: Performs arithmetic operations and multi-step calculations.
Project Structure
lib/: Contains the main Dart library files.

palindrome_checker.dart: Implements the PalindromeChecker class.
sorting_algorithms.dart: Implements the SortingAlgorithms class.
basic_calculator.dart: Implements the BasicCalculator class.
bin/: Contains the entry point of the application.

main.dart: Executes the main functionalities.
test/: Contains unit tests for the project components.

palindrome_checker_test.dart: Tests for the PalindromeChecker class.
sorting_algorithms_test.dart: Tests for the SortingAlgorithms class.
basic_calculator_test.dart: Tests for the BasicCalculator class.
pubspec.yaml: Project configuration file.

Functionality
Palindrome Checker
PalindromeChecker.isPalindrome(String input): Checks if a string is a palindrome. It ignores spaces, punctuation, and is case-insensitive.
PalindromeChecker.isNumberPalindrome(int number): Checks if a number is a palindrome by converting it to a string.
Sorting Algorithms
SortingAlgorithms.bubbleSort(List<int> list): Sorts a list of integers using the bubble sort algorithm.
SortingAlgorithms.mergeSort(List<int> list): Sorts a list of integers using the merge sort algorithm.
Basic Calculator
BasicCalculator.calculate(double num1, double num2, String operator): Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %).
BasicCalculator.multiStepCalculation(List<double> numbers, List<String> operators): Handles multi-step calculations using a list of numbers and operators.
